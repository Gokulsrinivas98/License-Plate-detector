# License-Plate-detector
Number Plate Recognition is one of the most important elements in vehicle identification. Nowadays number of vehicles are increased everywhere, so it becomes very essential to identify licensed vehicle. In this paper an algorithm for Automatic Number Plate Recognition uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with template matching technique. The proposed algorithm is mainly consisting of three main parts, Detection of Number Plate, Image Segmentation, and Number plate Identification. The proposed system is implemented in MATLAB, and its performance is tested on real images of number plates.
